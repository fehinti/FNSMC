   abstract = {The antilock braking systems are designed to maximize wheel traction by preventing the wheels from locking during braking, while also maintaining adequate vehicle steerability; however, the performance is often degraded under harsh road conditions. In this paper, a hybrid control system with a recurrent neural network (RNN) observer is developed for antilock braking systems. This hybrid control system is comprised of an ideal controller and a compensation controller. The ideal controller, containing an RNN uncertainty observer, is the principal controller; and the compensation controller is a compensator for the difference between the system uncertainty and the estimated uncertainty. Since for dynamic response the RNN has capabilities superior to the feedforward NN, it is utilized for the uncertainty observer. The Taylor linearization technique is employed to increase the learning ability of the RNN. In addition, the on-line parameter adaptation laws are derived based on a Lyapunov function, so the stability of the system can be guaranteed. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NN hybrid control system for antilock braking control under various road conditions.},

   abstract = {Many different control methods for ABS systems have been developed. These methods differ in their theoretical basis and performance under the changes of road conditions. The present review is a part of research project entitled “Intelligent Antilock Brake System Design for Road-Surfaces of Saudi Arabia” In the present paper we review the methods used in the design of ABS systems. We highlight the main difficulties and summarize the more recent developments in their control techniques. Intelligent control systems like fuzzy control can be used in ABS control to emulate the qualitative aspects of human knowledge with several advantages such as robustness, universal approximation theorem and rule-based algorithms.},
